# Glory 2 Him
This project will attempt to provide a Christian social media platform to allow people to share the Gospel and their love for God through posts (quotes, sayings, inspirations and testimonies). Posts are catagorized into topics through tags so that users can easily find content that might be of interrest to them.

Anonymous users will be able to see content submitted, but will have to register to be able to participate.

Registered users will have the ability to 
- contribute by posting their favourite quotes / sayings / inspirations
- comment on posts
- react on posts / comments (emoji reations - like, love, agree, ...)
- suggest tags for posts
- suggest links to external content that are realted / similar to the this post i.e. image or videos
- share content with other social media platforms
- follow people to see their posts and reations
